pyHyp
===========================

pyHyp is a hyperbolic mesh generator that automatically generates two or three dimensional meshes 
around simple geometric configurations. The basic idea is to start with an initial surface (or curve) 
corresponding to the geometry of interest and then grow or extrude the mesh in successive layers until 
it reaches a sufficient distance from the original surface. 
In the process, the entire space surrounding the geometry is meshed.
