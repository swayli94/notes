Gmsh
===========================

`Gmsh <http://gmsh.info//>`_ is an open source 3D finite element mesh generator with 
a built-in CAD engine and post-processor. 
Its design goal is to provide a fast, light and user-friendly meshing tool with parametric input and 
flexible visualization capabilities. Gmsh is built around four modules 
(geometry, mesh, solver and post-processing), which can be controlled with the graphical user interface, 
from the command line, using text files written in Gmsh's own scripting language (.geo files), 
or through the C++, C, Python, Julia and Fortran application programming interface.
