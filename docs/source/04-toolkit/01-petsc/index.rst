PETSc, the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation, 
pronounced PET-see, is a suite of data structures and routines for 
the scalable (parallel) solution of scientific applications 
modeled by partial differential equations. It supports MPI, and GPUs 
through CUDA, HIP or OpenCL, as well as hybrid MPI-GPU parallelism; 
it also supports the NEC-SX Tsubasa Vector Engine. (来自官网介绍)
